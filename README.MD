This project contains the gdxar library (the 'gdxar' module),
which is a small library to 'glue' together the worlds of GDX and ARCore.
It also contains a sample of how to use gdxar (the 'app' module).

The library and sample build upon the proof-of-concept from Google engineer Clay Wilkinson, which can be found at:
https://github.com/google/helloargdx

Changes to his original work involved a entire API change and extensive refactoring, including the
renaming of files, introduction of interfaces, and addition of utilities.

What follows below is his original README.



# Hello AR GDX - Using ARCore with libGDX


_Now updated for DP2 of the ARCore SDK!_


This is a port of the hello ar sample for ARCore to libGDX.
The most obvious advantage to this implemention is that there
is no requirement to use or understand OpenGL ES, which is
a large barrier to creating augmented reality apps in Java.

The sample shows the basics of ARCore: plane detection, anchoring objects
in space, and light estimation (coming soon).  In addition, it illustrates
how to use GDX to make an application and integrate non-graphical Android
UI such as Snackbars into the activity.

__DISCLAIMER__
This is not an official Google product.

I work at Google, but this specific project was created personally
as I investigated using ARCore in Java apps.  I can't commit to maintaining
or supporting this project's use.
